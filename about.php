	<div class="headline"><h2>About walkBud</h2></div>
	<p>walkBud was created when <a href="http://originaldougal.com/about">Dougal</a> and his partner found it tricky to communicate about the joint care of their dog Buddy on a daily basis. We wake up at different times, are in and out of the house at irregular hours, and we both want to know if Buddy pooped or not on his last outing, because he poops about every other time, and we don't want to waste our time walking in circles hoping he'll poop if he doesn't need to. Especially in cold Wisconsin winters.</p>
